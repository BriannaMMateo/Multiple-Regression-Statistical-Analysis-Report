# Multiple-Regression-Statistical-Analysis-Report

The purpose of our analysis is to examine the relationship that streaming time, followers, and being a Twitch partner have on the effect of your viewer growth as a Twitch streamer. Twitch Streamers are effectively full- time gamers. The best Twitch streamers make a living through paid subscriptions, donations, and influencer marketing. Using data from Kaggle, this Twitch Data set contains the Top 1000 Streamers from the past year on the streaming platform. We fit our multiple linear regression models with viewers gained as the response. We found evidence against our primary hypothesis that having a long stream time increases your growth in viewers, as we observed little to no relationship between stream time and viewers gained. Additionally, the following count does not appear to change the relationship between stream time and viewers gained for all Twitch streamers, partnered or not. Overall, the strength of the correlation between the independent and dependent variables suggests that further analysis must be conducted to determine the extent of growth of our dependent variables.
